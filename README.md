## My process

To create a NFT card component using semantic HTML and CSS styling, I started by creating the HTML structure of the card using semantic elements such as ``nd <main>``. Then, I used CSS to style the card's layout, background color, font family, and text styles.

Next, I added an image of the NFT to the card using the ``<img>`` tag and styled it with CSS. I used the styling guide to approximate dimensions and spacing.

Overall, creating this NFT card component using semantic HTML and CSS styling was a fun and straightforward process.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
